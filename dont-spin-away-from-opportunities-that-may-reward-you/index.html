                                    <p>If you think opportunities and rewards are just in your lap as you drive past, you may be surprised. Instead, you have to jump off the couch and find ways to find opportunities for your life. This is not a hippie suggestion that I tell you to open your chi and put sage in your window to lower the positive energy of the universe (though it wouldn't hurt, would it?). Rather, there are certain good habits that you fall into and that you can take apart from your everyday life, that make your name known and make people aware of you. The more places your name surrounds, the more people know that you exist, which means that you are offered more options.</p>

<p>People fear change because they fear uncertainty. There’s a comfort level involved in maintaining the status quo. You have the illusion of security, the illusion of knowing exactly how everything is going to turn out. There are two big problems with this philosophy:<p>
<ul><li>Big Problem #1—Nobody ever knows exactly how everything is going to turn out. They may think that they do, but there’s always something that doesn’t happen the way it’s supposed to. That’s why I referred to it as an “illusion” above. Now, you may know with some degree of accuracy how it’s going to turn out, but then again, you may be completely off-base, no matter how neatly you have your ducks lined up in a row.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Big Problem #2—By being resistant to change and by striving to maintain the status quo, you are stunting your own growth. Actually, you’re choosing not to grow because you’re putting obstacles in your path. There are risks involved in becoming better at what you do and becoming more successful as an individual and as a business. There are some people who choose to embrace the illusion of security over the risk inherent in the growing process.</li></ul>
<p>How does a significant opportunity differ from a simple option? How is it different from opportunists to take advantage of opportunities? Does our ability to predict the future affect our opportunities? What do we mean by equal opportunities?</p>

<p>Success in life, be it in any task or in any area, brings good luck and must be won again and again once it has been achieved. It is not easy, but the difficulty is the chance, the rewards are great, but it only belongs to the brave and brave souls who are keen to have faith in themselves. Those who recognize and seize opportunities seize them, use them and continue on the road to success. The winner says: It may be difficult, but it is possible. The loser says: It may be possible, but it is difficult. Which category do we want to belong to now? The winner or the loser?</p>

<p>“We all have happy breaks in our lives and careers. I found that most of my happiness was being in the right place at the right time or knowing the right people. The decisions I made along the way helped me deal with these situations. Most of my jobs have been with people I know, and I have had the opportunity to influence my community and my job through my willingness to say yes and introduce myself. I have a career that I love and that allows me to spend enough time with my family and do my extra-curricular activities. In short, I think I was lucky. "
Whatever you want, whatever your dreams are, you can gain more positive experiences and opportunities in your life by being more proactive and optimistic.</p>

<p>Every single person whom you encounter, even someone unpleasant, is put in your path for a reason. Always be open to hidden, unexpected possibilities in every one of your experiences. Every encounter, even the ones that ostensibly seem superficial, will offer you an opportunity to be kind, or be helpful, or to refine your emotional attributes. When you travel, even if its for business or pleasure, always be open for the spontaneous encounter that can change your life and the life of another.</p>
