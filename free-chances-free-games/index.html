                                    <p>Everyone loves games. Games are the best way to spend free time. We all love to play games after a tiring day. But you don't need to open your console or play a game on the smartphone. Instead, you can play games directly on your computer's browser. If you're bored in class, you can open games in your browser. There are tons of games available on the Internet. We have compiled a list of the top 5 browser games you should try.</p>
                                    <h3>Street skater</h3>
                                    <p>If you like skateboarding, this game is perfect for you. It has retro style graphics. You can control the skateboard and perform kickflips and ollies. The main goal of this game is to collect coins without dying. And with death, I mean a horrible death. Your body will break into thousands of pieces and your head will fly off when you hit an obstacle. So try to avoid obstacles as much as possible. You can press the space bar to perform airborne traps and bounce. If you want to slow down, just press the Shift button.</p>
                                    <p>Supported browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox</p>
                                    <h3>Prodigy</h3>
                                    <p>Prodigy is a fantasy-inspired MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) with more than 50 million players. It is dedicated to building children's confidence and improving math skills in an incredibly engaging way.</p>
                                    <p>As a young wizard, you cross the worlds of prodigious creatures and bosses who fight! (To win, you must answer a series of questions that adapt to your level of mathematics.) With each battle, your sorcerer gets closer and closer to find the long-lost keystones that will unlock the mysterious Academy.</p>
                                    <h3>Flow Colors</h3>
                                    <p>This online puzzle game challenges players in a different way! Your goal is to connect assorted colors using a pipe to fill the entire board. But don't let your pipes overlap, otherwise they will break!</p>
                                    <p>There are thousands of free levels available and 10 different card sizes. Flow Colors also offers different play modes to suit your mood - you can play to relax or run against the clock.</p>
                                    <h3>Heroes of the Storm</h3>
                                    <p>Although not directly advertised or considered internally as a MOBA, Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm has all the strengths of a MOBA. It is 5 against 5 and offers a wide range of heroes (currently 80) divided into four roles: specialist, warrior, support and assassin. Heroes of the Storm has not achieved the same level of notoriety as League of Legends or Dota 2, but it is a satisfying and profound experience in its own right. With 15 maps and a multitude of game modes, including ranked, unclassified and even CPU battles, Heroes of the Storm has enough content to keep you playing for the long haul. Sure, you must have an affinity for MOBA, but we've found that Heroes of the Storm is a little easier to integrate than League and Dota.</p>
                                    <h3>Cube Escape: Paradox</h3>
                                    <p>Since 2015, Rusty Lake has released a surprising number of under-the-radar games in the Cube Escape franchise. Cube Escape: Paradox is already the tenth entry in the series, and it happens to be one of the best. The series stars Detective Dale Vandermeer in his quest to understand the mysterious death of a woman. You don't need to play the other titles to get started in Paradox, because each one works well as a standalone device. In Paradox, Vandermeer wakes up without memory in a strange room. Think Saw but less harmful. Vandermeer must then solve a series of puzzles to escape. Like other Cube Escape games, Paradox combines movies and video games to create an exciting and new experience. Although you can only play the first episode for free, we strongly recommend that you check out this great series, especially if you like strange experimental games.</p>
